My implementation of various data structures 
## DATA STRUCTURE : LIST 
This is my List implementation which is written in Arr.cpp and LL.cpp files. There are 2 types of implementations : array based and linked list based. The basic operations of list are used in the task 1. Some new methods are introduced in task2.cpp using the basic methods of list implementation of list. In task 3, a CAR RENTAL SYSTEM is built using list, a car can be requested and returned to the garage. There are some rules such as requested car should be taken from the first non empty garage, should be returned to the last non full garage after the highest level of car of the garage. In task 3, I have used infix to postfix algorithm (as string) to evaluate the values of the correct expressions.
